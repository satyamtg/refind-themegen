# WIP: refind-themegen
A simple utility to make building rEFInd bootloader themes easier

It makes building rEFInd themes easier as you dont have to worry about -
1. Icon sizes - Just create svg icons
2. Font generation - Use any monospaced .ttf or .otf fonts directly
3. Selection image sizes - Automatically scaled according to icon size
4. Theme configuration in rEFInd - Just state your themename, fontname and a theme.conf will be generated automatically

Many more features to come
